# AGENTS.md — ripdl

Standing instructions for AI agents working in this repository. Keep this file
current when build commands, architecture, or conventions change.

## What this is

`ripdl` — a free, ad-free, multi-segment download manager in Rust. An
open-source alternative to IDM (overpriced) and FDM (ad-supported). Zero
telemetry, zero ads, forever — non-negotiable, code it into no feature.

## Layout

- `crates/ripdl-core` — pure library: HTTP engine (probe/plan, multi-segment
  ranges, sidecar resume, retry/backoff, cancellation), RPC protocol types.
- `crates/ripdl-cli` — thin CLI over core + daemon RPC (`download`, `info`,
  `add`, `ls`, `pause`, `resume`, `rm`, `stop`).
- `crates/ripdl-daemon` — queue owner: persistent queue at
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ripdl\queue.json`, one runner per task, EMA speed tracking.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — phase plan; keep checkboxes current for every
  completed/added item.
- `docs/rea-findings.md` — REA research notebook (P4 browser-capture work).

## Commands

```sh
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo test -p ripdl-core
cargo build --workspace
```

Integration tests are fully offline: `crates/ripdl-core/tests/` contains a
hand-rolled mock HTTP server (drop-injection, no-range mode, etag switching).
Never hit real networks in tests.

Smoke-test URL (manual verification only):
`https://speed.cloudflare.com/__down?bytes=N` — no range support, exercises
the single-stream path.

## Environment gotchas

- **PowerShell**: `cargo ... 2>&1 | Select-Object ...` wraps stderr as
  NativeCommandError and mates exit code 1 even on success. Judge by output
  lines (`Finished`, `test result: ok`), not the exit code.
- Builds: Rust 1.98 MSVC target. Workspace root is `D:\ripdl`.
- Session daemon port: TCP 5593 (see `ripdl_core::rpc::DEFAULT_PORT`).

## Conventions

- **Engine first, frontends thin.** New capabilities land in `ripdl-core`
  (pure lib) and are exposed through the daemon; CLI/GUI are shells.
- **Clean-room REA rules** (for all reverse-engineering work on incumbents):
  understand behavior, never copy decompiled code or assets, never strip
  license checks. Record findings in `docs/rea-findings.md`; stash downloaded
  artifacts in `research/` (gitignored).
- **License**: MIT OR Apache-2.0. No GPL dependencies in first-party code —
  torrent support must go through `librqbit` (Apache-2.0), not GPL clients.
- **No telemetry of any kind.**
- Commits: use `git -c user.name="ripdl" -c user.email="ripdl@localhost" commit …`.
  One commit per coherent unit, terse imperative subject.

## Resume-sidecar format

`<file>.ripdl.json` (`TaskStateFile` with per-segment `done` offsets).
Sentinel `u64::MAX` = UNBOUNDED (no range support → single stream; retries
restart the stream from zero). Segment writes are buffered (256 KiB) and
flushed via the blocking pool; `cells[index].done` advances only for durable
bytes.

## Current status

Check `docs/ROADMAP.md` checkboxes for ground truth. As of 2026-10-17:
P0/P1 core complete: multi-segment download, resume, retry, daemon + RPC,
persistent queue, buffered writes, shared speed limiter, header/auth/cookie
pass-through, Content-Disposition naming, duplicate-URL idempotency. 21 tests
pass offline (`cargo test --workspace`).
In progress: P4 browser integration — REA research done; bridge +
`register-host` + MV3 extension landed and capture verified live twice
(temp Chrome profile -> daemon -> file). Extension now has: SW-race matching
(700ms + content-length + initiator), correct suggest/cancel discipline,
popup with capture toggle and OPT-IN cookie sharing (optional permission,
off = permission revoked entirely). Original commit: "ext hardening: SW-race
matching, suggest discipline, opt-in cookie sharing (popup + optional
permission)". Tests: 27 pass offline. Next: selection/all-links capture
(on-demand scripting), DNR fallback referer, then scheduler backlog.
